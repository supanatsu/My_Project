## P1. Personalized Activity Recommendation Model

*(Course: Applied Machine Learning)*

### **🎯 Business Problem**
To address the business challenge of providing personalized activity recommendations to a segment of customers who lack complete preference data (lifestyle or favorite information).

### **✅ Solution & Impact**
* **Methodology:** Developed a **Machine Learning-based Recommendation System** utilizing **Cosine Similarity** on customer demographic and activity history data to generate `activity_profiles`.
* **Key Output:** Successfully delivered the **Top 3 most suitable activity recommendations** per customer, filling a critical gap in customer engagement.
* **Deployment Readiness:** Proposed integrating the model into the existing **CRM System** for automated, data-driven customer outreach and immediate delivery of benefits.

### **🛠️ Technical Stack**
Python, Scikit-learn (implied), **Cosine Similarity**, Data Modeling.

## P2. Data Warehouse Design and BI Dashboard Implementation

*(Course: Data Warehousing)*

### **🎯 Business Problem**
To create a centralized and reliable source of truth for sales data for 'Dairy King' to support strategic decision-making.

### **✅ Solution & Impact**
* **Data Engineering:** Designed and implemented a logical **Star Schema Data Warehouse** to consolidate complex sales data from multiple source systems.
* **ETL Process:** Managed the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline to ensure data quality, integrity, and readiness for analysis.
* **BI Reporting:** Delivered a **Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard** using **Metabase** (or similar BI tool principles) to visualize critical **KPIs** (e.g., Total Sales per branch, Average Daily Sales, Coupon Usage Rate) for rapid executive review.

### **🛠️ Technical Stack**
Data Warehousing, **Star Schema**, **ETL Process**, Data Modeling, Metabase (or Power BI/Tableau principles).

## P3. Customer Ordering Behavior Analysis & Data Visualization

*(Course: Data Visualization)*

### **🎯 Business Problem**
To analyze customer ordering behavior (Pizza ALOYS dataset) and transform raw data into clear, actionable business strategies.

### **✅ Solution & Impact**
* **Analysis:** Identified key sales trends, including the **peak ordering period (12:00 – 19:00)** and the day with the highest sales (Friday) vs. the lowest (Sunday).
* **Visualization:** Constructed an **Interactive Dashboard** that provides management with a dynamic view of sales by time, day, and product category.
* **Strategic Recommendation:** Proposed specific data-driven promotional campaigns (e.g., **'Sunday Family Deals'**) to stimulate sales during identified low-volume periods.

### **🛠️ Technical Stack**
Data Visualization (Tableau/Power BI Principles), Dashboard Development, Business Insight Generation, Sales Analysis.

## P4. User Segmentation using Data Clustering

*(Course: Fundamentals of Data Science)*

### **🎯 Objective**
To apply unsupervised learning techniques for effective user segmentation based on demographic and behavioral factors, laying the groundwork for targeted marketing.

### **✅ Solution & Impact**
* **Clustering:** Applied **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering)** using **Euclidean distance** metrics to segment user data efficiently.
* **Prototyping:** Demonstrated basic application development by designing a functional **Data Input Form** and processing logic for the model.
* **Model Persistence:** Utilized the **joblib** library for saving and loading the trained model, confirming its readiness for integration into a production environment.

### **🛠️ Technical Stack**
Python, **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**, **joblib** (Model Persistence), Unsupervised ML.
