# 🌟 [01] Personalized Activity Recommendation Model

## 🎯 Project Overview: Solving Business Engagement

This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques to solve a critical business problem for **Company ABC** (a loyalty program provider): providing personalized activity recommendations to a segment of customers who lack complete preference data (lifestyle/favorite information).

The solution provides a data-driven approach to boost customer engagement and optimize personalized benefit offerings.

## ✨ Key Features & Business Impact

* **Targeted Recommendation:** Successfully generated personalized activity recommendations for customers with missing profile data.
* **Methodology:** Utilized **Cosine Similarity** on customer demographic and activity history to create accurate `activity_profiles`.
* **Actionable Output:** The model outputs the **Top 3 most suitable activity recommendations** per customer.
* **Deployment Readiness:** Proposed integration of the final model (with optimal performance, e.g., high F1-Score) into the existing **CRM System** for immediate deployment and benefit delivery.

## ⚙️ Technical Stacks

## 🚀 Getting Started (How to Run the Analysis)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourRepositoryName].git
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebook:** Load the `Prediction_Model_V1.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.
3.  **Run Cells:** Execute all cells sequentially, starting with data loading and preprocessing, to view the modeling process and final recommendation output.

## 💾 Project Files
